# Brotea Agent Education Platform

## Overview

Brotea is an open-source ecosystem of AI agents for Web3 education and mobile app development. The platform simplifies onboarding and enables component reuse through intelligent guidance and educational tools.

## Vision

We're building an education platform powered by AI agents that helps anyone create mobile components while learning Web3 concepts. Our goal is to democratize access to Web3 and mobile development knowledge through guided, interactive learning experiences.
